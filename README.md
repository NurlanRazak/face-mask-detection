Going to use OpenCV to do real-time face mask detection from a live stream via our webcam.

# Mask Detection using MobilenetV2

In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

# Technology Used

OpenCV: https://opencv.org/

MobileNetV2: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381

Keras: https://keras.io/

TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/

# DataSet: 

This dataset consists of 3835 images belonging to two classes:

with_mask: 1916 images
without_mask: 1919 images
The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:
